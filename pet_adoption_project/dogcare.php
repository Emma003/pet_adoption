                <li> Dont overfeed your Dog:</li>
                   <blockquote>
                    Overfeeding can significantly impact their health and happiness. According to a survey in U.S.A more than 50% of the dogs are obese and the number is on the rise.
                    Overweight dogs are at an increased risk of metabolic abnormalities, cardiovascular diseases and also a lowered immune system.

                <li>Touch your dog's nose</li>
                <blockquote>Your dog's nose should feel wet. The level of moisture will vary between dogs and by time of year, but a healthy dog will have a cool and slightly wet nose because dogs secrete sweat through their nose to cool down.</blockquote>
                <li>Walk your dog for both their health and happiness</li>
                <blockquote>Regular walks provide many benefits for your dog, including preventing boredom, helping the digestive tract, keeping them at a healthier weight, and helping them to burn off excess energy.</blockquote>
                <li>Get pet insurance</li>
                <blockquote>Emergency and unexpected accidents and illnesses often cost $800 to $1500. With as many as a third of pets needing emergency care per year, this can quickly become a financial burden. Pet insurance can help to cover these unexpected costs, prescription medications, long term health conditions and more, making it an important investment for the furry members of your family.</blockquote>
                <li>Be a friend to your dog</li>
                <blockquote>Dogs need love and affection to thrive. Make sure they're spending plenty of time inside with you and your family. Give them attention, treats, and play games with them.</blockquote>
