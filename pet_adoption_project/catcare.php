                 <li>Brush Your cat everyday</li>
                 <blockquote>Brushing or combing your cat daily will cut down on the hairballs that can develop in the digestive tract. Because cats spend so much time grooming themselves, some owners may not realize that brushing is something that can help their pet by removing loose hair.</blockquote>
                 <li>Don't Feed Your Cat Too Much Dry Food</li>
                 <blockquote>Unlike dogs, cats cannot be vegetarians, even for short periods of time. They rely on meat as the foundation of their diets, and the main meal of the day should always be meat, says Werber.</blockquote>
                 <li> Provide a Sufficient Number of Litter Boxes</li>
                 <blockquote>As far as potty places go, Werber says a good rule of thumb is to have one litter box per kitty, plus an additional one. So if you have three cats, you should set up four boxes. </blockquote>
                 <li>Pay Attention to Your Pet's Thirst</li>
                 <blockquote>Dry food is only 5% to 10% water on average. Give your cat access to fresh water at all time, and you may notice cats drinking more when they are eating more dry food.</blockquote>
                 <li> Don't Assume You Know Why a Cat Is Peeing Outside the Box</li>
